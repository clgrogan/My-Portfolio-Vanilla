# Portfolio web site using HTML, SCSS/SASS, and a bit of JavaScript

This project is built using HTML5, and SCSS/SASS (CSS3).

I specifically avoided using Bootstrap, React, Angular, Vue, or other templates, frameworks, or libraries similar to these to provide a pure HTML/CSS project.

As a future project I may create a portfolio with a backend database that would be accessed via Angular or React. If you search my GitHub repository in the future (past March 2021) perhaps it will be around.
