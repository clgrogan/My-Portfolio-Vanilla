            I am a reborn software developer following my passion by returning
            to the field. After completing the immersive Full Stack Web
            Developer program at the prestigious Suncoast Developers Guild, I
            have joined the FDM Group as a Software Engineer Consultant. I love
            learning new skills & technologies and collaborating with colleagues
            to expand my understanding of the technology and people with whom I
            work.

            The quote that brought me back to the fold is by Howard Thurman,

              >“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive,
              and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come
              alive.”</span
